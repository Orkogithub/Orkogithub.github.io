Check out our new Calm Release
[Calm5.8.1](https://portal.nutanix.com/#/page/docs/details?targetId=Release-Notes-Calm-v581:Release-Notes-Calm-v581)


New and Updated Features
This release includes the following new features or enhancements.

Support for AWS GovCloud FEAT 6959
GovCloud (US) is an isolated AWS region to help the United States government agencies and federal IT contractors to host sensitive workloads into the cloud by addressing their specific regulatory and compliance requirements. GovCloud is now available as a new region in the AWS Provider configuration.

AWS C2S is now available as a provider in Nutanix Calm Settings.

Linux Powershell Gateway FEAT 7360
Prior to Nutanix Calm 5.8.1, for windows automation you needed to deploy Karan service into a separate windows VM. Nutanix Calm now comes with support for Powershell on Linux, doing away with the requirement for a separate VM.

The blueprints which were earlier created by using pre 5.8.1 Karan are still supported. However, these blueprints are not automatically migrated to use the in-built linux powershell gateway.
