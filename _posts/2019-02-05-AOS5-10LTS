New AOS LTS release. AOS 5.10.1 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release which is a software release that Nutanix commits to maintain and support for longer than other releases, to provide greater stability to customers who have longer new feature adoption cycles. Any release that is not designated as LTS will be deemed to be a Short Term Support (STS) Release.
